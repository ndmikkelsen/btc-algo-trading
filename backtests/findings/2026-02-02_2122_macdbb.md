## Configuration

  "MACD_SLOW": 26,
  "MACD_SIGNAL": 9,
  "BB_PERIOD": 20,
  "BB_STD": 2.0,
  "BB_NEAR_THRESHOLD": 0.02,
  "BB_LOOKBACK": 5,
  "EXIT_ON_UPPER_BB": false,
  "USE_TREND_FILTER": true,

  "starting_capital": 1000
}
```

## Risk Management Rules

- **2:1 R:R minimum**: 5% stop loss / 10% take profit
- **5% max risk per trade**: $500 position × 5% = $25 risk
- **Max 2 trades open**: Limits total exposure
- **Starting capital**: $1,000 USDT

## Lessons Learned

1. **2:1 R:R requires wider stops for mean reversion** - Tight 3% stops with 6% targets had only 27% win rate. Widening to 5%/10% improved win rate to 41.7% and turned strategy profitable.

2. **Win rate isn't everything** - 75% win rate with poor R:R lost money. 41.7% win rate with proper 2:1 R:R is profitable. Math matters more than feelings.

3. **ADX filter prevents falling knife entries** - Blocking entries when ADX > 25 AND DI- > DI+ avoids strong downtrends where mean reversion fails.

4. **Trailing stops need room to breathe** - 10% activation offset lets winners develop before trailing kicks in. Too tight = premature exits.

5. **Patience pays** - Only 12 trades in a year, but quality over quantity. Each trade has proper setup and risk management.

## Optimization History

| Version | Config | Profit | Win Rate | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| V1 | 3% stop, 4% ROI | -6.95% | 75.0% | Poor R:R (0.2:1) |
| V2 | 3% stop, ROI ladder | -3.53% | 75.0% | Better profit capture |
| V3 | 3% stop + ADX filter | -2.73% | 71.1% | Avoids downtrends |
| V4 | 3% stop / 6% target (2:1) | -7.57% | 27.3% | Stops too tight |
| **V5** | **5% stop / 10% target** | **+6.82%** | **41.7%** | **Profitable!** |

## Next Steps

- [ ] Paper trade for 2-4 weeks before live deployment
- [ ] Test on ETH/USDT and SOL/USDT for diversification
- [ ] Run hyperopt on BB_LOOKBACK (3-7) and ADX_THRESHOLD (20-30)
- [ ] Consider adding volume confirmation for higher quality entries
- [ ] Test 1D timeframe for potentially cleaner signals
