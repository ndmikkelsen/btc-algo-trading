## Analysis

- **Strong win rate** (75.0%) indicates reliable entry signals
- **Negative profit factor** (0.59) - losses exceed wins
- **Outperformed buy-and-hold** by 13.68%
- **Acceptable drawdown** (0.00%)

## Notes

Initial MACD+BB strategy with 3% stop loss, exit signals disabled. Strategy outperforms buy-and-hold by 14% in bear market (-6.21% vs -20.63%). Trailing stop is highly effective (100% win rate).

## Configuration

```json
{
  "MACD_FAST": 12,
  "MACD_SLOW": 26,
  "MACD_SIGNAL": 9,
  "BB_PERIOD": 20,
  "BB_STD": 2.0,
  "BB_NEAR_THRESHOLD": 0.02,
  "BB_LOOKBACK": 5,
  "EXIT_ON_UPPER_BB": false,
  "STOPLOSS": -0.03,
  "TRAILING_STOP": true,
  "TRAILING_STOP_POSITIVE": 0.01,
  "TRAILING_STOP_POSITIVE_OFFSET": 0.015
}
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Exit signals can hurt performance** - MACD bearish crossover exits had 0% win rate in earlier tests. By the time MACD crosses bearish, the trade is already losing. Trailing stops work better.

2. **Trailing stop is highly effective** - 100% win rate on trailing stop exits. Let winners run with trailing stop rather than fixed exit signals.

3. **Entry logic is sound** - 75% win rate shows MACD crossover + recent lower BB touch is a valid entry signal for oversold bounces.

4. **Strategy outperforms in bear markets** - Even with negative absolute returns, outperforming buy-and-hold by 14% is valuable risk management.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add trend filter (ADX > 25) to avoid trading in choppy/ranging markets
- [ ] Test with multiple pairs (ETH/USDT, SOL/USDT)
- [ ] Run hyperopt on BB_LOOKBACK and BB_NEAR_THRESHOLD parameters
- [ ] Consider adding volume confirmation to entry signals
- [ ] Test 1D timeframe for potentially cleaner signals
