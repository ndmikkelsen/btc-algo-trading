The strategy's real edge appears to be in **giving winners room to run**, not tight stop management. The current 3.0x ATR initial stop may be too tight for BTC's volatility.\n\n## Goals\n\n1. Determine if MRBB has a statistically significant edge\n2. Find the optimal stop distance and decay schedule\n3. Quantify fee drag and net-of-fees profitability\n4. Understand regime-dependent performance\n5. Paper trade validated configuration\n6. Deploy with small capital if edge is confirmed\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- Statistical significance test (p \u003c 0.05 for Sharpe \u003e 0)\n- Net-of-fees Sharpe \u003e 0.5 on out-of-sample data\n- Regime analysis showing consistent edge in target market conditions\n- 30-day paper trade with no code bugs or execution issues\n- Clear go/no-go decision based on evidence","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-02-21T11:35:14.15188-06:00","updated_at":"2026-02-21T12:09:41.885401-06:00","closed_at":"2026-02-21T12:09:41.885401-06:00","close_reason":"EPIC COMPLETE — NO-GO.
