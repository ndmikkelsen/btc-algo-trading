## The Goal

**A data-driven, automated Bitcoin trading system that generates consistent returns across all market conditions.**

We're building a trading system where:

- Strategies are **backtested against 10+ years of data** before deployment
- Decisions are made by **algorithms, not emotions**
- Performance is **measured and optimized** continuously
- Risk is **managed systematically**

Not gambling. **Systematic, evidence-based trading.**

---

## What We're Building

### A Complete Trading System

- **Strategy Library** - Multiple proven strategies (momentum, mean reversion, hybrid)
- **Backtesting Engine** - Full historical validation across market regimes
- **Paper Trading** - Validation before real capital
- **Live Trading** - Automated execution with risk controls
- **Analytics** - Performance tracking and optimization

### The Workflow

```
Research -> Implement -> Backtest -> Paper Trade -> Live Trade -> Analyze -> Iterate
```

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Sharpe Ratio | > 1.5 | Risk-adjusted returns |
| Max Drawdown | < 25% | Capital preservation |
| Win Rate | > 40% | Positive expectancy |
| Profit Factor | > 1.5 | Winners > losers |
| Uptime | > 99% | Always in the market |

## Core Principles

### 1. Data Over Intuition

Every strategy must prove itself against historical data. No "gut feelings."

### 2. Survive First, Profit Second

Risk management is non-negotiable. Preserve capital to stay in the game.

### 3. Simple Beats Complex

The best strategies are often the simplest. Complexity adds overfitting risk.

### 4. Continuous Improvement

Markets evolve. Strategies must adapt. Regular review and optimization.

### 5. Automation Over Manual

Emotions kill returns. Let algorithms execute without interference.
